## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Yan Jie!

Iâ€™m a Software Engineering student at the University of Malaya, currently in my third year.

I enjoy connecting with people from different cultures, love creating things that tell a story, and believe tech should always make life a little brighter âœ¨

âœ¨Course Expectation : 
Iâ€™m excited to learn how to keep software working well and improve it over time in this course.

âš¡Fun fact:
Many people think Iâ€™m from the Faculty of Engineeringâ€¦ but Iâ€™m actually from Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology ðŸ˜†

ðŸ’¬Letâ€™s connect!
Always happy to meet new people, learn something new, or just share ideas over a good chat.
